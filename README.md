# 11 Express.js: Note Taker


## Description

This app allows users to quickly jot down notes and save them for later use. The app uses Express.js back end and retreives the users notes from a JSON file by using Express.js requests. The user can add and remove notes from the JSON file by interacting with the apps front end.

## Tasks 

- Linked the front end starter code with my own backend code.
- Used express.js to interact with assets in my public folder and display it on the main page.
- Created pathways in the server.js which switches the page or dynamically populates the page with json data.
- utilized POST, GET, and DELETE requests.
